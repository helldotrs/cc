"""
Create a function named remove_middle which has three parameters named my_list, start, and end.

The function should return a list where all elements in my_list with an index between start and end (inclusive) have been removed.

For example, the following code should return [4, 23, 42] because elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 have been removed:

remove_middle([4, 8 , 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3)
"""
#Write your function here

remove_middle(my_list, start, end):
  pass

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(remove_middle([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3))
