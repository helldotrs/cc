# Write your average function here:

def average(a,b):
  # mistead, good solution to the wrong problem: steps = abs(a-b)

  return (a+b)/2

# Uncomment these function calls to test your average function:
print(average(1, 100))
# The average of 1 and 100 is 50.5
print(average(1, -1))
# The average of 1 and -1 is 0
